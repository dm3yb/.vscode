### ðŸ“¦ Extensions:

I'm using more than `100` extensions to make my developer life better. Listing all of them and keeping them up to date would be challenging, so I've created a **personal Extensions Pack** that I use almost every day:

1. **Install the Extension Pack:**
   - Install the [WebDev Extensions Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SandStormDevBand.sandstorm-webdev-extensions-pack)  from the VSCode marketplace.
2. **Enjoy!**
   - Once installed, you can start using the extensions included in the pack to enhance your development experience.

By following these steps, you can easily set up the same extensions I use to improve your workflow.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Useless Functions:

1. **Remove Unused Icons:**
	- Right-click on the function or extension you no longer need.
	- Uncheck the function/extension to remove it.

   - Install the [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) extension from the VSCode marketplace.

   - Press `Cmd + P`, type and select `>Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` to open the `settings.json` file.

4. **Add Custom CSS Path:**
   - Add the following property to your `settings.json` file:
     ```json
     "vscode_custom_css.imports": ["file:///Users/MyUserName/someFolder/editor.css"]
     ```

5. **Enable Custom CSS:**
   - Restart Visual Studio Code by pressing `Cmd + P`, typing and selecting `>Enable Custom CSS and JS`.
